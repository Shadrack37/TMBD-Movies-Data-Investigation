## by (Shadrack Mwangi)

## Dataset
The Movie Database (TMBD) is a user editable database for movies and TV shows. This dataset has more than 10,000 rows of data. The columns are tagline, overview, runtime, genres, production companies, release date, vote count, vote average, release date, id, idmbd id, popularity, budget, revenue, original title, cast, homepage, and director.

## Summary of Findings
There is a relationship between movies budget and movies revenue. The higher the budget of a movie was, the higher the revenue was for the movie. The most produced movie genres are drama, comedy and thrillers. It would make sense if a producer would specialize on the three types of movie as the seem to the most marketable movie.
